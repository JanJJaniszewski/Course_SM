\section{Introduction}

\section{Data}
To measure the operational efficiency of six airlines in the United States between 1970-1984 in our sample, we measure the revenue per passenger-mile flown. Earlier research has shown (REF) that key performance indicators total cost of the airline, the fuel price, and the load factor* are important measures to predict operational efficiency. Further, we control for the year of observation, however, we do not use individual dummies for each year, but a continuous variable. This is important as when the model is used to predict a year forward this is not possible with a dummy for the year we are attempting to predict. Finally, a dummy is included for each of the 6 airlines.\\
We use the data from Greene (2003), which has annual observations on 6 airlines on the described variables, 15 observations per airline in total, summary statistics are included in Table XXX. We scale all variables except the airline dummies to create z-scores; $(X â€“ \mu) / \sigma$  where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and the standard deviation respectively. This is essential, as our approach is relying on distance between observations, by scaling we ensure equal importance for each variable.
