\section{Data}
The code's construction was done by iterating over the Iris dataset. The code was further tested in the smoke dataset, so it could be compared to the results obtained during the lecture.

\section{Results}
The decision tree produced by the algorithm (from now on refered to as Decision Tree), with a max number of leaves equal to 16 and the minimum sample size of 5 produces the confusion matrix from Table 1:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{l|l|c|c|c}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{}&\multicolumn{2}{c}{Observed}&\\
\cline{3-4}
\multicolumn{2}{c|}{}&Don't Int. Smoke&Int. Smoke&\multicolumn{1}{c}{Total}\\
\cline{2-4}
\multirow{2}{*}{Predicted}&Don'tInt. Smoke & $97$ & $27$ & $124$\\
\cline{2-4}
& Int. Smoke & $16$ & $60$ & $76$\\
\cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Total} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$113$} & \multicolumn{    1}{c}{$87$} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$200$}\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:table-name}Confusion Matrix for the Decision Tree}
\end{table}

The Decision Tree was intended to overfit, and, above the complexity induced by this set of parameters, there was no improvement in the fit statistics and the confusion matrix was stable. Another decision tree was fit using the Rpart packge from R (call it Rpart Decision Tree). The confusion matrix, created using this second model, is depicted in Table 3. The complexity of the model was also increased to obtain an overfitting tree, and the results stabilized at max depth of 8 and minimum samples to do a split equal to 5.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{l|l|c|c|c}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{}&\multicolumn{2}{c}{Observed}&\\
\cline{3-4}
\multicolumn{2}{c|}{}&Don't Int. Smoke&Int. Smoke&\multicolumn{1}{c}{Total}\\
\cline{2-4}
\multirow{2}{*}{Predicted}&Don'tInt. Smoke & $97$ & $27$ & $124$\\
\cline{2-4}
& Int. Smoke & $16$ & $60$ & $76$\\
\cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Total} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$113$} & \multicolumn{    1}{c}{$87$} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$200$}\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:table-name}Confusion Matrix for the Rpart Package}
\end{table}

Both implementations generated the same confusion matrix (see Table 1 and 2) and fit statistics (see Table 3).

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
            & Decision Tree & Rpart \\ \hline
Accuracy    & 0.78          & 0.78  \\
Sensitivity & 0.86          & 0.86  \\
Specificity & 0.69          & 0.69 
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:table-name}Fit Statistics for The Decision Tree and the Rpart Decision Tree}
\end{table}

How the tree partitions the data (rules), the prevalence of class 1 (intention to smoke equals to 'yes') and the size of each split can be seen in the diagram on Figure 1. The variable the algorithm selects for the first split is 'Friends smoke', and it is capacle of screening the data in two groups with starkly distinct prevalence for the target, 17% who have no friends who smoke are willing to smoke, while 65% of the ones that have friends who smoke intends to give it a try. The next splits for both groups is alcohol consumption per month: for the group with no smoking friends, drinking less than 4 times a month results in a group with 11% of people intending to smoke, while drinking 4 or more puts them in a group with 27%. Although the same variable is used in the second split for the group with smoking friends, the split here occurs at 2 times a month: the group that drinks 1 or less times a month is associated with a 34% prevalence of intention to smoke, while its counterpart can be associated with a prevalence of 79%. For the last 4 splits, the variable associated are two: 'whether the subject has lied to his/her parents' for the groups stemming from the one that did not have friends that smoke and 'age' for the groups stemming from the one with no friends that smoke. It is interesting to notice that here the responses disagree as lying to parents is both associated with a larger prevalence of intention to smoke for the group that consumes alcohol less than 4 times per month and with a smaller prevalence for the other group. A similar effect can be pointed out for the group with friends that smoke. The group that drinks more often has a boost in prevalence of intention to smoke if they are 16 or older, but has a reduction of prevalence if they come from the group that drinks less often.
